# Econometric-Projects
Welcome to my Econometrics Projects repository!

Here, you will find a collection of small econometric projects that I enjoy working on in my spare time to hone my skills and deepen my understanding of econometric concepts. From simple regression analysis to more complex modeling exercises. These projects serve as a playground for exploring economic data, testing hypotheses, and refining my analytical abilities.

Feel free to explore the projects :)
